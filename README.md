 We created this link for our article to provide a "Data and Code Availability Statement".
Our article is titled "Deep supervised score creation and multisource feature nomogram for stroke prognosis assessment", which was coauthored by Xicheng Chen, Wei Ye, et al.
 Consistent with the manuscript, our code can be divided into two or four categories based on differences in outcome variables. 
 In terms of methods, our code contains rich charts such as logistic regression, nomograms, calibration curves, decision curves, and more.
The codes for logistic regression can be found in "logistic regression_2class","logistic regression_4class.py",Nomograms are coded in "Nomogram_2class.R","Nomogram_4class.R", The calibration curve and decision curve can be found in “Decision Curve Analysis.R”.
